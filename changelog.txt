v0.0.6:
    - refactoring

v0.0.5:
    - bugfix: Basically the same bug as for v0.0.4, different reason. Now no longer uses the predict from skearn even if ndim=None.
    - OPLS object no longer allows predictions

v0.0.4:
    - bugfix: predict did not work with newest sklearn without the ndim parameter. Now should work.

v0.0.3:
    - skipped

v0.0.2:
    - PLS calculates coefficients for all number of components. An additional parameter "ncomp"
      is addeed to predict, inverse_predict and score. The change also applies to OPLS_PLS (but
      only on the underlying PLS object) and OPLS has the parameter added, but it is ignored.
