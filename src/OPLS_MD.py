    Parameters
    ----------

        With flip=True and deflation_mode="regression" the PLS model will be the same
        (up to machine precision) as with sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression.
        With flip=False and univariate y, the x_scores_ are guaranteed to be positively

    max_iter : int, default=500

    deflation_mode : str, default=None

        The latter only is reliable with n_components<=Y.shape[1]. The first will make this the same as
        sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression and the latter the same as

        NOTE: "O2PLS" is not yet well tested, and OPLS is only tested with univariate y.
    deflation_mode : str, default=None
